When someone taps your card with their smartphone, it instantly opens your digital profile in their browser. They can save your contact with one click, view your portfolio, connect on LinkedIn, or schedule a meeting—all without downloading any apps. For phones without NFC (rare these days), a QR code on the back provides the same functionality. It's networking made effortless."

  "FAQs": [
    {
      "question": "Do I need an app to use DigIT-Hack digital visiting cards?",
      "answer": "No app required! DigIT-Hack cards work with any smartphone using NFC technology (tap-to-share) or the QR code printed on the back. When someone taps your card with their iPhone or Android phone, it opens your digital profile directly in their web browser. They can then save your contact, view your portfolio, or connect on social media—all without downloading anything."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I change my phone number or email address?",
      "answer": "Simply log into your dashboard and update your details. Changes take effect immediately and everyone who has your digital card or profile link will see the updated information automatically. This is the biggest advantage over paper cards—you never need to reprint or redistribute when your contact details change. You can update your profile unlimited times at no additional cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this work with all smartphones, including older models?",
      "answer": "Yes. While modern iPhones (iPhone 7 and newer) and most Android phones have built-in NFC for tap-to-share, we include a QR code on every card as a backup. Older phones or phones without NFC can simply scan the QR code with their camera to access your profile. This ensures 100% compatibility across all devices."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the card last? Is there a subscription fee?",
      "answer": "The physical card has a lifetime warranty and the NFC chip is rated for 100,000+ taps. The first year of premium dashboard access (unlimited updates, analytics, custom forms) is included free. After one year, you can continue with free basic features or renew premium access for ₹499/year. The card itself never expires and you retain access to your profile permanently."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I have multiple digital cards for different purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. You can purchase multiple physical cards and create separate profiles for each—for example, one for your primary business, another for a side venture, or different cards for professional vs personal networking. You manage all cards from one dashboard and can easily switch between profiles or share specific ones based on context."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my information secure? Can anyone access my profile?",
      "answer": "Your profile is only accessible to people you share your card with or those who have your unique profile link. You control what information is displayed—you can hide phone numbers, show only business emails, or create public/private versions. All data is encrypted and stored on secure servers. We never sell your information to third parties and you can delete your profile anytime."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if someone viewed my digital card?",
      "answer": "Your dashboard includes detailed analytics showing every profile view with timestamp, geographic location, device type, and which links were clicked. For premium users, you can also add lead capture forms that collect visitor information when they view your profile, building your contact database automatically. This helps you prioritize follow-ups with genuinely interested contacts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I customize the design of my card?",
      "answer": "Yes! For individual orders, you can choose from our template library and customize colors, add your logo, and select layout preferences. For corporate bulk orders (20+ cards), we offer fully custom designs matching your exact branding guidelines, including custom colors, fonts, layouts, and even special finishes. Our design team works with you to create cards that perfectly represent your brand."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you ship across India? How long does delivery take?",
      "answer": "We ship to all cities and towns across India via reliable courier services. Standard delivery takes 5-7 business days to major cities (Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata) and 7-10 days to other locations. Express delivery (3-4 days) is available for urgent orders. Bulk corporate orders are handled with dedicated logistics and account manager support. Free shipping on orders above ₹5,000."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm not satisfied with my card?",
      "answer": "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with your DigIT-Hack card for any reason, return it within 30 days for a full refund, no questions asked. Additionally, all cards come with a lifetime warranty against manufacturing defects—if your card stops working due to a defect (not physical damage), we'll replace it free of charge. Your satisfaction and successful networking are our priorities."
