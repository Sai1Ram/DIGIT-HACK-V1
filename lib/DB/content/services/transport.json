For purchased devices, one-time hardware cost is ₹3,000-8,000 per vehicle, plus software at ₹300-500/vehicle/month. Complete Transport Management System with GPS, trip management, and billing ranges from ₹50,000-3 lakhs for setup, plus ₹10,000-50,000/month based on fleet size. We offer customized packages—10 vehicles, 50 vehicles, or 500+ vehicles with volume discounts. Free trial available."
        },
        {
            "question": "What GPS devices do you support and can I use my existing GPS trackers?",
            "answer": "We support all major GPS device brands including Ruptela, Teltonika, Concox, GT06, Coban, Suntech, and 100+ other manufacturers. If you already have GPS devices installed, we can integrate them with our software—no need to buy new hardware. Our platform works with both 2G and 4G GPS trackers. We also offer device-free mobile app tracking using driver smartphones. We help you choose the right devices based on your vehicle types and tracking requirements, and can supply devices at competitive rates if needed."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I track vehicles in real-time and view their location history?",
            "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Our system provides real-time GPS tracking with 30-second interval updates showing current vehicle location, speed, direction, and status on interactive maps. You can view live location of your entire fleet simultaneously or focus on individual vehicles. Historical route playback lets you see exactly where any vehicle traveled on any past date—useful for verifying trips, investigating customer complaints, or analyzing driver routes. Reports show complete movement history with timestamps, stoppages, and route deviations."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does the software work across all states in India and support offline tracking?",
            "answer": "Yes, our transport management software works pan-India with nationwide GPS coverage. We use Indian maps (Google Maps and MapMyIndia) showing accurate roads, toll plazas, and landmarks across all states. The system automatically handles state border crossings with alerts and compliance tracking. For areas with poor network coverage (remote highways, hills), GPS devices store location data locally and sync automatically when network returns—so you never lose tracking data. Mobile apps have offline trip details and POD capture capability."
        },
        {
            "question": "How long does it take to implement GPS tracking for my fleet?",
            "answer": "Implementation depends on fleet size. For small fleets (5-20 vehicles), basic GPS tracking can be live within 1-2 weeks—device installation takes 1-2 hours per vehicle. Medium fleets (20-100 vehicles) need 3-4 weeks including phased rollout. Large fleets (100+ vehicles) require 4-8 weeks with pilot testing before full deployment. Transport Management System with custom workflows needs additional 2-4 weeks for setup, data migration, and training. We handle everything: device procurement, installation coordination, software configuration, staff training, and go-live support."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I set up geofences and get alerts for specific locations?",
            "answer": "Yes, geofencing is a core feature. Create unlimited geofences around your godowns, customer locations, state borders, toll plazas, or any area. Get instant alerts via SMS, email, WhatsApp, or app notification when vehicles enter or exit these zones. Set different alert rules for different geofences—for example, get notified only for after-hours exits from your warehouse, or when vehicles deviate from planned routes. Geofence reports show all entry/exit times with duration spent inside each zone, perfect for verifying loading/unloading times and detention charges."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does the system help reduce fuel costs and detect fuel theft?",
            "answer": "Yes, significantly. Our system reduces fuel costs through: (1) Route optimization suggesting shortest/fastest paths, (2) Idle time monitoring to reduce unnecessary engine running, (3) Overspeeding alerts—vehicles running at optimal speeds consume less fuel, (4) Mileage reports comparing GPS distance vs odometer readings to detect tampering, and (5) Fuel sensor integration for real-time fuel level monitoring and theft detection. Most clients report 20-30% fuel cost reduction within 3 months. Detailed fuel consumption reports help identify inefficient vehicles and drivers for targeted improvement."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can customers track their shipments and get delivery updates?",
            "answer": "Yes, we provide white-labeled customer tracking portal. Generate unique tracking links for each consignment that customers can access without login. They see real-time vehicle location, current status, estimated delivery time, and delivery history. Automated WhatsApp/SMS notifications keep customers informed about shipment pickup, in-transit updates, and delivery completion with POD photos. This reduces 'where is my order' calls by 70% and improves customer satisfaction. You can brand the tracking page with your company logo and colors for professional appearance."
