Mid-sized solutions (advocate office, visitor management) range ₹3-6 lakhs. Comprehensive systems (hotel HMS, complete HRMS) cost ₹6-15 lakhs depending on features, integrations, and user count. Cloud-based subscription models available starting ₹5,000/month. We provide detailed quotes after understanding your specific requirements. Most clients achieve ROI within 8-12 months through efficiency gains and reduced manual effort."

            "question": "Can you integrate with our existing biometric devices or accounting software?",
            "answer": "Yes, absolutely. We integrate with all major biometric attendance systems (eSSL, ZKTeco, Realtime, Mantra, Suprema), RFID card readers, and access control systems. For accounting, we connect with Tally, QuickBooks, Zoho Books, and other software via API for automated data synchronization. We also integrate payment gateways (Razorpay, PayU), WhatsApp Business API, email services, Google Calendar, hotel channel managers, and industry-specific tools. If you have existing systems, we build around them rather than forcing you to replace working infrastructure."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is the software GST-compliant and suitable for Indian businesses?",
            "answer": "Yes, all our workplace management solutions are built for Indian businesses with complete GST compliance. Features include automated GST calculations, HSN/SAC codes, e-invoicing integration, GSTR report generation, TDS calculations as per IT Act, PF/ESI compliance for payroll, and financial year-based reporting. We also support Indian payment methods (UPI, NEFT, RTGS), work with Indian festivals and holidays, and handle state-specific taxes. Our solutions are updated whenever there are regulatory changes to ensure continuous compliance."
        },
        {
            "question": "How long does it take to implement workplace management software?",
            "answer": "Implementation timelines depend on solution complexity. Simple systems (gym management, visitor management) take 6-8 weeks from requirement gathering to go-live. Medium complexity solutions (CA/advocate office, basic HRMS) need 10-14 weeks. Comprehensive systems (hotel HMS, enterprise HRMS with payroll) require 16-20 weeks including customization, integration, and data migration. We follow agile methodology with weekly demos showing progress. For urgent needs, we can do phased rollouts—core features first, advanced modules later—to get you started faster."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you provide training for our staff and ongoing technical support?",
            "answer": "Yes, comprehensive training is included in all projects. We provide role-based training for admins, managers, frontline staff, and end-users with hands-on practice sessions, user manuals, video tutorials, and practice environments. Training can be on-site or online based on your preference. Post-implementation, you get free technical support for 6 months including bug fixes, doubt resolution, and minor enhancements. We offer 24/7 support via phone, email, WhatsApp, and remote access. AMC packages available from ₹20,000/year for ongoing support, updates, and feature additions."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can the software handle multiple locations or branches?",
            "answer": "Yes, our workplace management systems are designed for scalability. Manage unlimited locations (office branches, hotel properties, gym centers) from a single centralized dashboard with location-wise data segregation, role-based access (branch managers see only their location, admins see everything), consolidated reporting across locations, inter-branch transfers or movements, and unified policies with local customizations. Perfect for growing businesses expanding to multiple cities or franchisees operating in different regions."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is cloud-based software secure and what about data backup?",
            "answer": "Security is our top priority. We implement bank-grade 256-bit SSL encryption for data transmission, secure cloud hosting on AWS/Azure India data centers, role-based access with audit trails tracking all user actions, two-factor authentication option, and regular security audits. Your data is automatically backed up daily with 30-day retention, stored in multiple locations for disaster recovery, and you can export your complete data anytime—no vendor lock-in. We maintain 99.9% uptime SLA with redundant infrastructure ensuring your business never stops."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can clients/guests/members access their information online?",
            "answer": "Yes, we build client portals and mobile apps for self-service. CA clients can upload documents and check filing status, law firm clients can view case updates and hearing dates, hotel guests can make bookings and modify reservations, gym members can book classes and track progress, and employees can view payslips and apply for leaves. This reduces phone calls and emails to your staff by 60-70%, improves customer satisfaction with 24/7 access, and creates a modern, professional image for your business. Portals are white-labeled with your branding."
        },
        {
            "question": "What reports and analytics does the software provide?",
            "answer": "Our management systems generate comprehensive reports covering all business aspects: revenue and expense analysis, client/customer/member acquisition and retention trends, service-wise profitability, staff productivity and performance metrics, pending tasks and deadline tracking, compliance status and upcoming requirements, inventory levels and reorder alerts, and payment collections and outstanding receivables. All reports are customizable, can be scheduled for automatic email delivery, exportable to Excel/PDF, and viewable on mobile. Interactive dashboards show real-time KPIs for quick decision-making."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can we customize the software as our business grows?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. Our workplace management solutions are built on flexible architectures allowing easy modifications and additions. As your business evolves, we can add new features, create custom workflows, integrate additional systems, expand user capacity, add new locations, and develop specialized modules. Unlike off-the-shelf software with fixed capabilities, custom solutions grow with your needs. We maintain long-term relationships with clients, providing ongoing enhancements at reasonable costs. Many clients start with basic features and gradually add advanced capabilities as they see value and ROI."
