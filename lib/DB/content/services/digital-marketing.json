            "question": "How much does digital marketing cost and what ROI can we expect?",
            "answer": "Digital marketing investment varies based on your goals, industry competition, and chosen services. Basic packages for small businesses start at ₹25,000-40,000/month (SEO + social media + content). Mid-sized business packages range ₹60,000-1,00,000/month (comprehensive SEO, PPC, social media). Enterprise solutions cost ₹1,50,000-3,00,000+/month (full-service omnichannel marketing). For PPC, typical ad budgets are ₹50,000-5,00,000/month depending on industry. Our average client sees 3-5x ROI on total marketing spend within 6-12 months—meaning ₹3-5 in revenue for every ₹1 invested. B2B clients often see even higher returns due to higher customer lifetime values."
        },
        {
            "question": "How long does it take to see results from SEO and digital marketing?",
            "answer": "Timeline varies by channel. PPC advertising shows immediate results—traffic and leads within days of campaign launch. Social media engagement typically improves within 4-6 weeks. SEO is a longer-term investment with significant results appearing in 4-6 months—you'll see rankings start improving after 2-3 months, but major traffic growth happens around month 6-12. Content marketing builds momentum over time. Most clients see measurable business impact (increased leads, sales, revenue) within 3-6 months. Digital marketing is not a quick fix but a sustainable growth strategy. Unlike traditional advertising that stops when you stop paying, SEO and content marketing continue delivering results long-term."

        {
            "question": "Do you work with businesses in our industry and location?",
            "answer": "Yes, we serve businesses across all industries and locations in India. We've successfully executed campaigns for software companies in Bangalore, e-commerce stores in Delhi, healthcare providers in Mumbai, real estate developers in Pune, educational institutions in Hyderabad, manufacturing companies in Ahmedabad, and service businesses across tier 2 and tier 3 cities. We understand local markets, regional consumer behavior, and language preferences. For B2B companies, we've handled pan-India and even international campaigns. Our team includes industry specialists—tech marketing experts for SaaS, e-commerce specialists for retail, healthcare marketing professionals, and more. During discovery, we research your specific competitive landscape."

        {
            "question": "What makes DigITHack different from other digital marketing agencies?",
            "answer": "Four key differentiators: (1) We're both a software development company and marketing agency—we build technically excellent websites AND drive traffic to them, giving integrated advantage. (2) We focus on business outcomes (revenue, qualified leads) not vanity metrics (followers, impressions). (3) Complete transparency with real-time dashboard access, detailed monthly reports, and no long-term lock-in contracts. (4) We assign dedicated team members, not junior staff juggling 20+ clients. You work with the same SEO specialist, content writer, and PPC manager throughout. We've ranked 500+ keywords in top 3, managed ₹5+ crores in ad spend, and generated thousands of qualified leads for Indian businesses."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can you guarantee first page Google rankings or specific results?",
            "answer": "No ethical SEO agency can guarantee #1 rankings—Google's algorithm has 200+ ranking factors and changes constantly. Anyone promising guaranteed rankings is either lying or using black-hat tactics that will get you penalized. What we DO guarantee: transparent reporting, white-hat best practices following Google guidelines, measurable improvement in visibility and traffic, regular communication, and our best effort backed by proven track record. For most competitive keywords, we achieve page 1 rankings within 6-12 months. For PPC, we guarantee professional campaign management and continuous optimization, but actual results depend on your budget, offer quality, and market competition. We set realistic expectations upfront."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you require long-term contracts or can we cancel anytime?",
            "answer": "We work on monthly rolling contracts with 30-day notice for cancellation—no 6-month or 12-month lock-ins. However, digital marketing is a long-term investment, and switching agencies frequently disrupts progress. SEO takes 6-12 months to show full results. We recommend committing to at least 6 months to see meaningful ROI. For PPC campaigns, you can pause/resume anytime since results are immediate. That said, 95% of our clients continue beyond the first 6 months because they see results. We earn your business every month by delivering value. If you're unhappy, we'd rather fix issues than trap you in a contract. Our average client relationship spans 2+ years."
        },
        {
            "question": "Will we own the content, campaigns, and assets you create?",
            "answer": "Yes, absolutely. All content created (blog posts, social media posts, ad copy, graphics, videos) becomes your intellectual property. Google Ads, Facebook Ads accounts are set up under your business name—you maintain ownership and admin access. If you ever leave (though we hope you won't!), you take everything with you: written content, images, ad accounts, analytics access, and keyword research. We don't hold your assets hostage. The only things that remain with us are our proprietary strategies, templates, and processes. Unlike some agencies, we believe in empowering clients with full transparency and ownership."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you measure success and report on campaign performance?",
            "answer": "We track metrics that matter to your business, not vanity metrics. Key performance indicators include: organic traffic growth, keyword rankings (position and search volume), qualified lead generation (form submissions, calls, demo requests), conversion rates, cost per acquisition (CPA), return on ad spend (ROAS), revenue attributed to marketing, and customer lifetime value. You get: (1) Real-time dashboard access to Google Analytics, Search Console, and ad platforms, (2) Monthly detailed PDF reports with insights and recommendations, (3) Bi-weekly strategy calls to discuss progress, and (4) Direct access to your account manager via email/WhatsApp. We explain everything in plain language, not marketing jargon."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you handle social media posting, content creation, and community management?",
            "answer": "Yes, full-service social media management is included in our packages. We handle: content calendar planning with strategic mix of posts, graphic design and video creation, daily posting on your channels, community management (responding to comments/DMs within 24 hours), influencer outreach and collaborations, paid social advertising, hashtag research, platform-specific best practices, and monthly performance reports. You approve the content calendar upfront, but we handle day-to-day execution. For brands that want more control, we offer content creation only (you post) or hybrid models. Our social media managers understand Indian audience preferences, festival marketing, regional nuances, and platform algorithms."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can you help with both organic marketing (SEO) and paid advertising (PPC) together?",
            "answer": "Absolutely, and we recommend this integrated approach. SEO builds sustainable long-term traffic and authority, while PPC delivers immediate visibility and conversions. Together, they're powerful: use PPC data to inform SEO keyword strategy, dominate page 1 with both organic and paid results, run PPC while SEO gains traction (then reduce ad spend as organic improves), retarget organic visitors with paid ads to boost conversions, and allocate budget based on what's working best. We manage your entire digital presence cohesively rather than siloed tactics. Most successful clients invest in both—PPC for quick wins and testing, SEO for long-term growth and lower cost per acquisition."
