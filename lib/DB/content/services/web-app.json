      "question": "How long does it take to develop a custom web application or mobile app?",
      "answer": "Timeline depends on complexity. A simple website takes 3-4 weeks, a standard web application requires 8-12 weeks, and a full-featured mobile app (iOS + Android) typically needs 12-16 weeks. For startups, we offer rapid MVP development in 8 weeks to get your product to market quickly. We follow agile methodology with bi-weekly milestones, so you see progress continuously and can launch core features sooner while additional capabilities are being developed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I build a web app, mobile app, or both?",
      "answer": "It depends on your users and use case. If your audience primarily uses desktop or needs SEO-driven discovery, start with a responsive web application. For services requiring device features (camera, GPS, push notifications) or frequent daily use, a mobile app is better. Many of our clients start with a Progressive Web App (PWA) that works across all devices, then develop native mobile apps once they've validated product-market fit. We help you make this decision based on user behavior data and business goals, not just technical preferences."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you develop apps for both iOS and Android?",
      "answer": "Yes. We offer both native development (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) and cross-platform development using React Native or Flutter. Cross-platform development is cost-effective and faster, allowing you to launch on both platforms simultaneously while sharing 70-80% of code. Native development provides slightly better performance and access to the latest platform features. For most businesses, React Native or Flutter delivers excellent results at 40% lower cost than building separate native apps."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in your web development services?",
      "answer": "Our comprehensive package includes: requirement analysis and planning, UI/UX design with mockups, responsive frontend development, backend and database development, API integration (payment gateways, third-party services), SEO optimization, security implementation, quality testing, hosting setup, and post-launch support. You get complete source code ownership, documentation, admin panel training, and 3 months of free bug fixes and minor updates after launch."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you redesign or improve my existing website/application?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We frequently take over existing projects for redesign, performance optimization, feature additions, or complete platform migration. We start with a thorough audit of your current application, identify issues and opportunities, then create a phased improvement plan that maintains business continuity. Whether it's modernizing an outdated website, fixing performance issues, improving user experience, or adding new features, we ensure smooth transitions with minimal disruption to your users."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure my application is secure?",
      "answer": "Security is built into every layer. We implement HTTPS/SSL encryption, secure authentication (JWT, OAuth), input validation and sanitization, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, CSRF tokens, regular security patches, encrypted data storage, role-based access control, and secure API endpoints. Before launch, we conduct security audits and penetration testing. We comply with industry standards including OWASP guidelines and data protection regulations. For enterprise applications, we provide additional security measures like two-factor authentication, IP whitelisting, and audit logging."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens after my application is launched?",
      "answer": "Launch is just the beginning. We provide 3 months of free support covering bug fixes and minor updates. Beyond that, we offer Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC) including hosting management, security updates, performance monitoring, monthly backups, feature enhancements, and 24/7 technical support. We also help with growth activities like analyzing user behavior, A/B testing new features, conversion rate optimization, and scaling infrastructure as your user base grows. Many clients retain us long-term as their technology partner."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide app publishing and App Store Optimization services?",
      "answer": "Yes. We handle the complete app publishing process for both Google Play Store and Apple App Store, including developer account setup, compliance with platform guidelines, app screenshots and descriptions, privacy policy creation, and submission management. We also provide App Store Optimization (ASO) services to improve your app's visibility through keyword optimization, compelling descriptions, visual assets, and review management strategies to increase organic downloads."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you integrate third-party services into my application?",
      "answer": "Definitely. We have extensive experience integrating payment gateways (Razorpay, Stripe, PayU, Paytm), SMS/email services (Twilio, SendGrid), maps (Google Maps, Mapbox), analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Clevertap), CRM systems (Salesforce, Zoho), social login (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn), cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary), and hundreds of other third-party APIs. If a service has an API, we can integrate it into your application seamlessly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with startups and small businesses, or only large enterprises?",
      "answer": "We work with businesses of all sizes across India. Our client portfolio includes early-stage startups building MVPs, growing MSMEs digitizing their operations, and established enterprises launching new digital initiatives. We understand startup budget constraints and offer flexible payment terms, lean MVP approaches, and scalable solutions that grow with your business. Whether you're a solo entrepreneur in Bangalore or a mid-sized company in Mumbai, we provide the same level of expertise and commitment to deliver exceptional results."
