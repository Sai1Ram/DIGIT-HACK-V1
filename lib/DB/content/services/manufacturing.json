  "FAQs": [
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to develop a custom ERP for manufacturing?",
      "answer": "A basic manufacturing ERP MVP typically takes 8-12 weeks to develop. Complete enterprise solutions with advanced features like IoT integration, AI-powered analytics, and multi-location support may require 16-24 weeks. We follow an agile approach with phased rollouts, so you can start using core modules while additional features are being developed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can your manufacturing software integrate with existing machinery and systems?",
      "answer": "Yes, our ERP solutions are built with integration flexibility. We can connect with legacy systems, CNC machines, PLCs, barcode scanners, weighing scales, and other shop floor equipment using standard protocols like OPC-UA, MQTT, REST APIs, and custom middleware. We've successfully integrated with SAP, Tally, and various industry-specific applications."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide support for manufacturing units outside major cities?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. While our primary expertise serves manufacturers in Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Delhi, we work with manufacturing units across India including tier-2 and tier-3 cities. We provide remote implementation, training, and 24/7 technical support via phone, email, and WhatsApp, with on-site visits available when needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes DigITHack different from other ERP software development companies?",
      "answer": "As a specialized software development company in India, we focus exclusively on custom solutions rather than forcing you into generic templates. Our team includes manufacturing domain experts who understand Indian compliance requirements (GST, excise, labor laws), work within MSME budgets, and deliver solutions that integrate seamlessly with your existing processes. We've helped 150+ manufacturing units achieve 70% processing time reduction through digital transformation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is cloud-based manufacturing software secure for sensitive production data?",
      "answer": "Yes, our cloud solutions use enterprise-grade security with data encryption, role-based access controls, regular backups, and compliance with ISO 27001 standards. We offer both cloud-based and on-premise deployment options. Many of our clients prefer cloud hosting on AWS or Azure for scalability and disaster recovery, while maintaining complete data sovereignty within Indian servers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I start with a basic system and add features later?",
      "answer": "Definitely. We recommend starting with an MVP covering your most critical workflows—typically production planning, inventory management, and basic reporting. This approach reduces initial investment and allows you to see ROI quickly. You can then add modules like quality control, vendor management, or advanced analytics based on actual usage patterns and business growth."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer maintenance and support after project completion?",
      "answer": "Yes, we provide comprehensive Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC) including 24/7 technical support, bug fixes, security updates, performance optimization, and quarterly feature enhancements. Our support team is available via dedicated helpdesk, phone, and WhatsApp to ensure minimal downtime for your manufacturing operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ROI can I expect from custom manufacturing software?",
      "answer": "Our clients typically achieve ROI within 12-18 months through reduced manual errors, lower inventory carrying costs (average 45% savings), improved resource utilization, faster production cycles (70% average time reduction), and better decision-making with real-time data. The exact ROI depends on your current processes, scale of operations, and specific pain points being addressed."
