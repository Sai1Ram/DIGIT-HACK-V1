        {
            "question": "Can your restaurant software integrate with Swiggy, Zomato, and other aggregators?",
            "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Our restaurant management system integrates with all major food delivery platforms—Swiggy, Zomato, Uber Eats, Dunzo, Thrive, and more. All orders from different sources (dine-in POS, your own app, aggregators) appear in one unified dashboard. Menu and inventory automatically sync across platforms—when you mark an item out of stock, it updates everywhere. Consolidated reporting shows orders and revenue from all channels. This integration eliminates juggling multiple tablets, reduces order errors, and ensures accurate inventory management across all sales channels."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you build custom food delivery apps like Swiggy/Zomato or just restaurant management software?",
            "answer": "We build both. For restaurants: we develop restaurant management systems with cloud POS, inventory, KOT, and billing. For food delivery platforms: we create complete marketplace solutions with customer app, delivery partner app, restaurant panel, and admin dashboard. You can have your own branded food ordering app to compete with or complement Swiggy/Zomato. We support both single-restaurant apps (for chains going direct-to-consumer) and multi-vendor marketplaces (for aggregators). The apps include real-time tracking, multiple payment options, loyalty programs, and delivery optimization. Available for Android and iOS."

        {
            "question": "How long does it take to implement restaurant software and train staff?",
            "answer": "Implementation timelines depend on complexity. Basic cloud POS for single restaurant takes 4-6 weeks: setup, customization, staff training, and go-live. Multi-location restaurant chains need 8-12 weeks including pilot testing and phased rollout. Custom food delivery app development requires 12-16 weeks from design to deployment. Staff training is straightforward—waiters learn basic POS in 2-3 hours, kitchen staff grasp KOT system in 1 day, managers need 1-2 days for reporting. We provide hands-on training, user manuals, and support during initial weeks. Most restaurants operate confidently within one week of launch."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does the POS system work offline if internet connection fails?",
            "answer": "Yes, our cloud POS has offline mode. You can continue taking orders, processing payments, and printing bills even without internet. All data is stored locally and automatically syncs to cloud when connection returns. This is crucial for restaurants where internet outages can't stop operations. KOT printing to kitchen also works offline via local network. Only real-time aggregator orders and online payment processing need internet—but those orders are already digital, so customers know delivery status. For dine-in and cash payments, you never have to turn away customers due to internet issues."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can we customize the menu, pricing, and features according to our restaurant type?",
            "answer": "Absolutely, customization is our strength. We tailor the system to your specific needs: multi-language menus (English, Hindi, regional languages), variant management (sizes, spice levels, add-ons), combo meal configurations, happy hour pricing, seasonal menu changes, chef specials, custom billing formats, loyalty program rules, and more. For QSR chains, we add combo customization. For fine dining, we include course management and wine pairing. For cloud kitchens, we optimize for delivery efficiency. You're not forced into rigid templates—we adapt the software to match your operational workflow and menu complexity."
        },
        {
            "question": "What reports and analytics does the restaurant software provide?",
            "answer": "Comprehensive reporting across all aspects: daily sales summary with payment mode breakdown, item-wise sales showing best and worst performers, hour-by-hour sales pattern for staffing optimization, table turnover rates for capacity planning, waiter-wise performance for incentive calculation, inventory consumption and wastage tracking, vendor-wise purchase analysis, customer database with ordering patterns, aggregator vs direct order comparison, profit margin analysis per dish, GST reports for filing, and customizable dashboards for KPIs. Reports available real-time on mobile app, exportable to Excel/PDF, and can be scheduled for automatic email delivery to owners."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you handle payment gateway integration and is it secure?",
            "answer": "We integrate all major payment gateways used in India: Razorpay, PayU, Paytm, PhonePe, CCAvenue, and Instamojo. Customers can pay via UPI, credit/debit cards, wallets, net banking, and EMI. For food delivery apps, we implement: PCI DSS compliant payment processing, 256-bit SSL encryption, tokenization for saved cards, OTP verification for security, instant payment confirmation, automated refund processing for cancellations, and settlement tracking with gateway reconciliation. For POS, we support EDC machine integration for card payments. All transactions are secure with industry-standard encryption and fraud detection mechanisms."

        {
            "question": "Can customers place advance orders and schedule deliveries for later?",
            "answer": "Yes, our food ordering platform supports scheduled orders. Customers can place orders hours or even days in advance, select specific delivery time slots, pre-order for parties or events, schedule recurring orders (like daily lunch), and set reminders for order placement. The restaurant panel shows advance orders separately with preparation time alerts. This feature is particularly valuable for catering services, corporate meal programs, birthday cakes, party platters, and restaurants planning ingredient procurement based on advance orders. Helps restaurants manage kitchen capacity during peak hours by spreading orders across time."

        {
            "question": "What ongoing support and maintenance do you provide after deployment?",
            "answer": "We provide comprehensive post-deployment support: 24/7 technical assistance via phone, WhatsApp, and remote access for critical issues, free bug fixes and minor enhancements for first 6-12 months, software updates with new features and security patches, staff retraining as needed when employees change, menu update assistance, aggregator integration troubleshooting, payment gateway issue resolution, and server monitoring for uptime. Annual Maintenance Contracts start at ₹30,000/year for single restaurants, ₹1-3 lakhs/year for chains, covering unlimited support, version upgrades, and feature additions. We maintain long-term relationships—your success is our success."
