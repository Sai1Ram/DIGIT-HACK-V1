A basic clinic management system starts from ₹3-5 lakhs, mid-sized hospital HMS ranges from ₹8-15 lakhs, while comprehensive multi-specialty hospital solutions can cost ₹20-40 lakhs. This includes patient management, billing, pharmacy, lab integration, and mobile apps. Cloud-based subscription models start at ₹15,000/month. We provide detailed quotes after understanding your facility's requirements, number of users, and integration needs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your healthcare software compliant with Indian medical regulations and data privacy laws?",
            "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Our healthcare software follows HIPAA-aware development practices and complies with Indian data protection regulations. We implement role-based access control, audit trails, data encryption, and secure authentication. Our solutions support Clinical Establishment Act requirements, Medical Council of India guidelines, and integrate with government initiatives like ABDM (Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission). All patient data is stored in Indian data centers with strict security protocols."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can you integrate the HMS with our existing diagnostic equipment and lab systems?",
            "answer": "Yes, we specialize in healthcare system integrations. We can connect your HMS with diagnostic equipment (X-ray, CT, MRI, ECG machines, blood analyzers), external lab systems via HL7/FHIR protocols, PACS for radiology, pharmacy systems, insurance TPA portals, and accounting software. Our team has experience integrating with most major medical equipment brands and healthcare IT systems used in India. We ensure seamless data flow without manual entry."
        },
        {
            "question": "How long does it take to implement a hospital management system?",
            "answer": "Implementation timelines depend on facility size and complexity. A small clinic system takes 8-12 weeks, medium hospital HMS requires 16-20 weeks, while large multi-specialty hospitals need 24-30 weeks from requirement gathering to full deployment. We follow agile methodology with phased rollouts—typically starting with registration and billing, then adding clinical modules. This allows your staff to adapt gradually while we ensure smooth data migration and comprehensive training."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you provide training for our hospital staff and ongoing technical support?",
            "answer": "Yes, comprehensive training is included. We provide role-specific training for doctors, nurses, reception staff, lab technicians, pharmacists, and administrators. Training includes hands-on sessions, user manuals, video tutorials, and practice environments. Post-deployment, we offer 24/7 technical support via phone, remote desktop, and on-site visits if needed. Our support package includes free bug fixes for 12 months, regular updates, and AMC options starting at ₹50,000/year for ongoing maintenance."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can doctors access patient records from their mobile phones or home?",
            "answer": "Yes, our healthcare solutions include secure mobile applications for doctors (Android & iOS) and web-based access. Doctors can view patient histories, lab reports, prescribe medications, manage appointments, and conduct video consultations from anywhere. All access is secured with multi-factor authentication, encryption, and activity logging. The mobile app works offline for critical data with automatic sync when internet is available. This is especially useful for emergency consultations and follow-ups."
        },
        {
            "question": "What happens to our existing patient data when we switch to your system?",
            "answer": "We handle complete data migration from your current system—whether it's Excel, Tally, another HMS, or paper records. Our process includes data cleaning, format conversion, validation, and secure transfer with zero data loss. We run parallel systems during transition period to ensure accuracy. Patient records, billing history, inventory data, and staff information are all migrated. We also provide rollback options if needed. Most migrations complete within 2-4 weeks depending on data volume."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can the software handle multiple hospital branches or clinic chains?",
            "answer": "Yes, our HMS is designed for multi-location healthcare organizations. You get centralized patient records accessible across all branches, consolidated reporting and analytics, inter-branch patient transfers, unified inventory and pharmacy management, and role-based access control for each location. Administrators can monitor all facilities from a single dashboard while each branch operates independently. Perfect for hospital chains, diagnostic center networks, or multi-location clinics expanding across cities."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you offer cloud-based or on-premise healthcare software solutions?",
            "answer": "We offer both deployment options. Cloud-based HMS (hosted on AWS/Azure India) provides anywhere access, automatic backups, no server maintenance, and starts at ₹15,000/month. On-premise solutions give you complete data control, work without internet, one-time cost of ₹8-20 lakhs. We also offer hybrid models combining local servers with cloud backup. Most modern healthcare facilities prefer cloud for scalability, accessibility, and disaster recovery, but we support whatever works best for your practice."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can patients book appointments and access their reports online?",
            "answer": "Yes, we develop patient portals and mobile apps that allow online appointment booking, rescheduling, and cancellations with real-time doctor availability. Patients can view and download lab reports, prescriptions, discharge summaries, and medical records securely. They can also make online payments, view billing history, rate doctors, and receive medication reminders. The portal integrates with WhatsApp for notifications. This reduces front desk workload by 40% and significantly improves patient satisfaction."
