            "question": "How much does school management software cost for our institution?",
            "answer": "School management software pricing depends on student strength and features. For small schools (up to 500 students), basic system costs ₹1.5-3 lakhs one-time setup plus ₹15,000-25,000/year subscription. Mid-sized schools (500-1500 students) need ₹3-6 lakhs setup plus ₹30,000-60,000/year. Large schools and colleges (1500+ students) require ₹6-12 lakhs setup plus ₹60,000-1.5 lakhs/year. Prices include all modules (admission, fee, attendance, exams, parent app), implementation, data migration, and training. Additional modules like transport GPS tracking, biometric integration, and online examination portal cost extra. We offer customized quotes after understanding your specific requirements and student count."

        {
            "question": "Can parents track their child's attendance, performance, and fee status?",
            "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Parents get dedicated mobile app (Android & iOS) and web portal with real-time access to their child's information. They receive daily attendance notifications via SMS, view complete attendance history with percentage, check exam marks and report cards instantly when results are published, track pending fee dues with payment history, pay fees online via UPI/cards/wallets, view and download fee receipts, see homework and assignments, track school bus location in real-time, communicate with teachers, view school circulars and event notifications. This transparency increases parent engagement and reduces 70% of phone calls to school office asking for basic information."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does the system support CBSE, ICSE, state board, and other curricula?",
            "answer": "Yes, our school management software is highly flexible and supports all educational boards and curricula in India—CBSE with 9-point grading and CCE assessment, ICSE with percentage system, all state boards (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, etc.), NIOS, IB (International Baccalaureate), IGCSE, and internal assessment patterns for colleges and universities. Report card formats are completely customizable to match your board requirements. We also support semester systems, trimester divisions, choice-based credit systems (CBCS) for colleges, and continuous evaluation methods. The system adapts to your academic structure, not the other way around."
        },
        {
            "question": "How long does it take to implement the school management system?",
            "answer": "Implementation timeline varies by school size and data volume. Small schools (under 500 students) can be live in 6-8 weeks including setup, data migration, and training. Medium schools (500-1500 students) need 8-12 weeks for complete rollout. Large institutions (1500+ students or colleges) require 12-16 weeks with phased module deployment. The process includes: requirement analysis, system configuration, existing data import (students, staff, fee history), customization, role-wise staff training, parent orientation, and pilot testing. We recommend starting implementation during vacation periods for smooth transition. On-site support is provided during initial weeks to ensure confident adoption."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can we integrate biometric attendance devices and GPS bus tracking systems?",
            "answer": "Yes, we integrate with all major hardware systems. For attendance: biometric fingerprint devices (eSSL, ZKTeco, Realtime, Mantra, Suprema), face recognition systems, RFID card readers, and mobile app-based attendance with GPS verification. Student and staff attendance automatically syncs with the software, generates reports, and triggers parent notifications. For transport: GPS tracking devices from any manufacturer integrate with our system showing real-time bus locations on map, route history, speed monitoring, geofence alerts, and automated parent notifications when child boards/alights. We handle complete integration setup—you don't need technical expertise."
